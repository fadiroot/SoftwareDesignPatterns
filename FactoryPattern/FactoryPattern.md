# 🏭 Factory Design Pattern

## 🧠 Core Concept
A **creational** pattern that:  
🔹 Centralizes object creation logic  
🔹 Hides instantiation details from clients  
🔹 Promotes loose coupling via abstraction

## ✨ Key Characteristics
| Icon | Principle |  
|------|-----------|  
| 🛠️ | Defines a creation interface |  
| 🔄 | Delegates instantiation to subclasses/factories |  
| 📦 | Encapsulates complex initialization |  
| 🔌 | Supports open/closed principle |  

## ✅ Benefits
| Icon | Advantage |  
|------|-----------|  
| � | **Centralized control** over creation |  
| ♻️ | **Easier maintenance** and updates |  
| 🛡️ | **Reduced coupling** between components |  
| ➕ | **Extensible** for new product types |  

## 📌 Metadata

| **Complexity** | ⭐⭐ |  
| **Common Uses** | Payments, Databases, UI, Plugins |

## 🌟 When to Use?
✔ System needs to **create objects dynamically**  
✔ Object creation is **complex or configurable**  
✔ Code needs to **support multiple similar types**
